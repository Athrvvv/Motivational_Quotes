## Features

- **Random Quote Fetching**: Utilizes the `fetch()` function in JavaScript to retrieve random motivational quotes from the [API Ninjas Quotes API](https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/quotes?category=happiness).
  
- **Display**: Dynamically updates the quote and its author (if available) on the webpage upon user interaction.
  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a visually appealing and user-friendly experience across different devices with CSS styling.

## How It Works
